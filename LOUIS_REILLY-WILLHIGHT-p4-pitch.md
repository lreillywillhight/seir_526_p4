# LOUIS REILLY-WILLHIGHT PROJECT 4


Overview:

utilizes Flask, MongoDB, and GraphQL - the project will be a site that can accept user data through a form, with the intended purpose of storing project details.

Information collected will include:
	-project name
	-organization that the project is associated with
	-team members involved
	-technologies used (with graphical icons)
	-start/finish dates
	-version/status

I'll be referencing http://graphQL.org and http://docs.mongodb.com for documentation and getting started.

Unfortunately - My timeline begins on Monday, August 17 (I was quite sick over the weekend and was unable to focus). I expect to have a completed project by the due date.

Monday - Flask frontend site setup:
	- landing page
	- register/login/delete user
	- form page to enter project data
	- viewing page to view project from mongo database (this will be parsed using graphQL)
	- set up basic graphQL server and mongo server
	- RESEARCH

Tuesday - begin integrating GraphQL server with mongo server
	- connect flask form field to mongo server
	- refine view page to allow user searches (GraphQL)
	- styling

Tuesday night/Wednesday morning - bugfixes/tweaks

Stretch goals:
	- dynamic styling, mobile-friendly
	- encrypted auth
	- graphics



Resources from the web:
	- Youtube 'Web Dev Simplified' well put together - informative and well paced (general graphQL implementation)
	- Medium.com tech blog site with very good articles (connecting an express server to mongoDB with graphQL)
